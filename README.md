# 🎮👾♟️ An infinite game

[Stratagems](https://stratagems.world) is an autonomous world where players are actual gods. They are literaly the one creating the world.

As an Autonomous World, Stratagems is permission-less and persistent. Its rules are immutable yet it is fully composable. We like to call such games: ["Infinite Games"](https://ronan.eth.limo/blog/infinite-games/)

## ♟️ What is stratagems exactly ?

Stratagems is a world created by players and anyone can join at any time. Players use a specific set of factions/colors to compete for control of the world. Alliances and betrayal are part of the arsenal as colors mix and shift on the board.

Stratagems is thus first and foremost a social game. Its main inspiration is [conquest.eth](https://conquest.game) who successfully created a deeply social game out of simple mechanics. Stratagems explores this further by having even simpler rules. It also reduces the gas cost to a minimum by spreading the actions over a week. It works because most of the game plays out in the conversations and strategies happening among the players.

While maximally on-chain, Stratagems scales with players by offering compelling off-chain gameplay thanks to its associated social complexity.

## 🎮 How do you play ?

Players participate in the game by depositing ETH (ratio to be defined) to place a new piece of land on the infinite sea. They specify its location and color/faction.

By doing so, they risk the associated ETH but also get a chance to potentially capture the same (and more) from other players.

More details coming soon! Follow our [twitter](https://twitter.com/stratagems_eth) or register your interest on our [website](https://stratagems.world)!

## 🎎 Who we are?

For now, it is just me, [Ronan Sandford](https://twitter.com/wighawag).

Ronan is a game designer working on Autonomous Worlds (including [conquest.eth](https://conquest.game) and [Ethernal](https://ethernal.land)). He likes to call them ["Infinite Games"](https://ronan.eth.limo/infinite-games/). He is also an active developer in the web3 space with contributions towards EIP like [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) and [EIP-2771](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771), but also tools like [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) and [Jolly-Roger](https://jolly-roger.eth.limo). He has been tinkering with on-chain NFTs with [Mandalas](https://mandalas.eth.limo) and [Bleeps](https://bleeps.art). You can find more on his [personal website](https://ronan.eth.limo).

## 💻 Install

> We are assuming here that you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed
>
> We also recommend to install [zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wighawag/stratagems.git
   cd stratagems
   ```

   > Note that you will need [git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.com/)

    Then, ensure the hooks are present:

    ```sh
    git lfs install
    ```

    And note that if you install git lfs after already cloning the repo, you will also need to execute the following:
    ```sh
    git lfs pull
    ```


2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Then Assuming you have [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) installed

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

   **And you are ready to go!**

> **Note** If you do not have [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) (on windows for example) you can use [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)
>
> ```bash
> pnpm start:wezterm
> ```
>
> Or you can also launch each component in their own process
>
> ```bash
> pnpm local_node
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm contracts:compile:watch
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm contracts:deploy:watch
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm indexer:dev
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm web:dev
> ```

## 👾 Play

Just navigate to the url mentioned in the console. If you have no other thing running, it should be [http://localhost:5173/]()

## Deploying to a network

Just execute the following

```bash
pnpm contracts:deploy:prepare <network>
```

and it will ask you few questions and get your .env.local setup with the var needed to deploy on the network of your choice.

You just need to have a endpoint url and mnemonic ready for it.

You can of course configure it manually with more option if you need

Then you can deploy your contract

```bash
pnpm contracts:deploy <network>
```
