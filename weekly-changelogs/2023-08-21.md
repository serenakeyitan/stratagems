- switched from pure webgl to pixi.js

    Was hesitant at first to switch. I like immediate mode to render a state, especially when the state do not change often.

    But it also meant I had to implement quite a few thing to get things displayed.

    The plan is to add some cool pixel-art asset for the game and while pure webgl would have allowed me to be as performant as possible, I would have to implement quite a few thing

    Pixi will allow me to implements graphics faset

- Pogressed on the contract and started the implementation of the black gems
    
    Quite few things to consider here. One thing to implement is keeping track of the stake. Or consider a design where stake is always 1 and everything else is refunded to players

    Writing this make me also realise I need to add documentation on the gameplay. The black gem is actually something new but crucially needed for the game and I can't explain it here.

- Need to test more but setup some basic test with scenario files. Can easily test new scenario including winnings.

    Scenario files are really useful. Much easier to test and visualise the test. 

    Need to support more complex scenario, winings, passage of time...
